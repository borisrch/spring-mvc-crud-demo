# Spring MVC CRUD Demo

## Summary

This is a basic CRUD application built with Spring 5 that connects to a MySql database via Hibernate. The application prototypes a Customer Relationship Manager that can Create customers, Update customers, and Delete customers on the database. 

This is my first Spring 5 application and I learned some of the core processes behind Spring, such as Spring Beans (Scopes and Lifecycle), Inversion of Control, Dependency Injection, Hibernate Transactions and HQL. Potential areas of improvement: Validation (client-side and server-side), implementation of Spring Security and Spring Session.
